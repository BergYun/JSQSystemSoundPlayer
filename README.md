# JSQSystemSoundPlayer [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer)

A fancy Obj-C wrapper for iOS [System Sound Services](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AudioToolbox/Reference/SystemSoundServicesReference/Reference/reference.html).

This class is a light-weight, drop-in component to play sound effects, or other short sounds in your iOS app. 
To determine your audio needs, see [Best Practices for iOS Audio](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009767-CH2-SW10).
Or, read the tl;dr version:

>*When your sole audio need is to play alerts and user-interface sound effects, use Core Audioâ€™s System Sound Services.*
>
>Your sound files must be:
>
>* No longer than 30 seconds in duration
>* In linear PCM or IMA4 (IMA/ADPCM) format
>* Packaged in a `.caf`, `.aif`, or `.wav` file

If this does not fit your needs, then this control is not for you! 
See [AVAudioPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerClassReference/Reference/Reference.html), instead.
